# Cadette42

42 is a software engineering school with a methodology that is based on projects and peer-to-peer learning. We are given problems that challenge our understanding of algorithms and programming logic.

This Repository has spawned from tears of passion, desperation and hard labour.
I hope you appreciate the back pain and dry eyes I have exchanged for knowledge of a fascinating discipline.
